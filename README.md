## Details:
**In this data analysis project, I delved into YouTube's trending videos, utilizing ETL and EDA to extract and analyze valuable data. By performing sentiment analysis on comment sections, I uncovered viewers' thoughts on trending content. Word clouds provided a visual representation of these opinions through relevant words and emojis. Further exploration involved visualizations to identify which video categories performed best on the trending page. Additionally, I analyzed viewer engagement across categories, pinpointing sections with the highest view-to-engagement ratio. Finally, correlations between views, likes, dislikes, and comments provided insights into user interaction patterns.**
