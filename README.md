**Studied YouTube's trending videos using ETL and EDA to extract and analyze valuable data, including viewer sentiment revealed through sentiment analysis of comment sections. Word clouds visualized these opinions through relevant words and emojis. Further exploration on 1,000,000 data points identified the most successful video categories on the trending page. Additionally, viewer engagement across categories was analyzed, pinpointing sections with the highest view-to-comment ratio. Finally, correlations between views, likes, dislikes, and comments provided insights into user interaction patterns.**
